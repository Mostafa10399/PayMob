## ðŸ§© Project Structure

The project is modularized into two main frameworks to ensure scalability, maintainability, and code separation:

### 1. CoreKit
- Handles all business logic and network operations.
- Responsible for:
  - API requests and responses.
  - Models and data parsing.
  - Business use cases and repositories.

### 2. AppUIKit
- Contains common components and shared UI utilities.
- Includes:
  - Reusable UI elements (e.g., buttons, labels, custom views).
  - Extensions, helpers, and other shared tasks that are UI-related.

## ðŸ“¦ Modularization & Flavors

The project is structured to support multiple targets and build configurations using Flavors, making it easy to manage environments like Development, Staging, and Production.
